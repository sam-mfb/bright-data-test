## Table-Setting Question

I'll search the project knowledge for Reddit's Motion to Remand and specifically footnote 8 regarding the Bright Data case.Based on footnote 8 of Reddit's Motion to Remand, Reddit makes the following argument regarding Anthropic's citation of *X Corp. v. Bright Data*:

**Reddit's Core Argument:**

Reddit contends that Anthropic's reliance on *X Corp. v. Bright Data Ltd.*, 733 F. Supp. 3d 832, 850-51 (N.D. Cal. 2024) is misplaced because the case analyzes the **wrong type of preemption** to support federal removal jurisdiction.

**Key Distinctions Reddit Makes:**

1. **Type of Preemption**: The *Bright Data* case analyzed only "ordinary affirmative defense of conflict preemption," not "complete preemption"

2. **Jurisdictional Significance**: Reddit argues that **only complete preemption can confer federal jurisdiction**, while conflict preemption cannot

3. **Legal Support**: Reddit cites two Ninth Circuit cases to support this distinction:
   - *ARCO*, 213 F.3d at 1114: "[U]nlike complete preemption, preemption that stems from a conflict between federal and state law is a defense to a state law cause of action and, therefore, does not confer federal jurisdiction over the case"
   - *Toumajian v. Frailey*, 135 F.3d 648, 654-55 (9th Cir. 1998)

**Bottom Line**: Reddit concludes that "conflict preemption does not provide a basis for removal," meaning Anthropic cannot use the *Bright Data* case to justify removing Reddit's case from state court to federal court.

## Legal-Analysis Question

I'll search for Anthropic's Notice of Removal and the Bright Data case to understand your original argument and how to respond to Reddit's footnote 8 objection.Based on my review of the documents, here's how you should respond to Reddit's footnote 8 argument:

## Strategic Response to Reddit's Footnote 8

Reddit's argument is technically correct but strategically misleading. Here's your counter-argument:

### 1. **Bright Data Addresses BOTH Express and Conflict Preemption**

Reddit cherry-picks Bright Data's conflict preemption discussion while ignoring that Judge Alsup's opinion **begins** with Section 301(a) express preemption analysis. The court states:

- "That provision **expressly preempts** state-law claims when a plaintiff's work 'come[s] within the subject matter of copyright' and state law grants 'legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright.'" (Bright Data at 850-51, emphasis added)

- The court then notes: "claims are not preempted if they fall outside the scope of [Section] 301(a)'s **express preemption** and are not otherwise in conflict with the Act." (*Id.* at 851, emphasis added)

### 2. **Section 301(a) Express Preemption CAN Support Complete Preemption**

Reddit's own Motion to Remand **concedes this critical point** in footnote 3:

> "Of these three types of ordinary defensive preemption, **only express preemption can possibly give rise to complete preemption under the Copyright Act**" (MTR at 10 n.3, emphasis added)

Multiple courts, including **Firoozye v. Earthlink Network, 153 F. Supp. 2d 1115 (N.D. Cal. 2001)**, hold that Section 301(a) effects complete preemption:

- "The preemptive force of § 301(a) of the Copyright Act **transforms a state-law complaint** asserting claims that are preempted by § 301(a) **into a complaint stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule**." (*Firoozye* at 1122-23)

- "**[C]ombined with the preemptive force of [section] 301(a)**, [this] compels the conclusion that Congress intended that state-law actions preempted by [section] 301(a) of the Copyright Act arise under federal law." (*Id.*)

Other courts agree: *Yu v. ByteDance Inc.*, 2023 WL 5671932, at *5 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2023) (collecting cases holding Copyright Act "qualifies as a unique preemptive statute" for complete preemption).

### 3. **Reddit Applies the Wrong Legal Test**

Reddit argues Bright Data analyzed only "conflict preemption," but **Reddit itself applies the Section 301(a) express preemption test** throughout its Motion. Reddit acknowledges that for complete preemption under the Copyright Act, courts ask:

> "(1) the work at issue falls within the scope of copyright subject matter, and (2) the law at issue grants rights equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the scope of copyright." (MTR at 11, citing *Ryan* and *Maloney*)

**This is the Section 301(a) express preemption test—the same test Bright Data applied.** Whether Judge Alsup also discussed conflict preemption is irrelevant to whether his substantive analysis applies.

### 4. **Bright Data's Substantive Analysis Controls**

The key holding in Bright Data—that state-law claims based on scraping public data to train AI "are **preempted by the Copyright Act**" because they seek to control reproduction of copyrighted content—applies regardless of whether it's labeled "express" or "conflict" preemption. The court held:

- X Corp's claims "based on scraping and selling of data are preempted by the Copyright Act" (*Bright Data* at 832)
- Such claims amount to "little more than camouflage for an attempt to exercise control over the exploitation of a copyright" (*id.* at 853)
- The claims "interfered with exploitation of copyright owners' exclusive rights" (*id.* headnote 27)

### 5. **The Real Issue: Are Reddit's Claims Within Section 301(a)?**

Reddit tries to avoid the jurisdictional question by focusing on labels, but the **dispositive issue** is whether Reddit's claims satisfy Section 301(a)'s two-part test:

1. **Subject matter**: Reddit users' posts are copyrightable works (Reddit doesn't contest this)
2. **Equivalent rights**: Reddit seeks to prevent Anthropic from copying and using those works—the quintessential reproduction right under 17 U.S.C. § 106(1)

If both prongs are satisfied under Section 301(a) express preemption, then complete preemption applies and removal is proper.

### **Recommended Argument Structure**

**I. Bright Data Is Directly On Point for Section 301(a) Express Preemption**
   - The decision analyzes express preemption under Section 301(a)
   - Reddit mischaracterizes the opinion by focusing only on its conflict preemption discussion

**II. Section 301(a) Express Preemption Effects Complete Preemption**
   - *Firoozye* and progeny establish this in the Ninth Circuit
   - Reddit concedes this point in its own brief (footnote 3)
   
**III. Reddit's Claims Satisfy Section 301(a)'s Two-Part Test**
   - Apply the same substantive analysis from Bright Data
   - Show Reddit's claims seek to vindicate copyright-equivalent rights

**IV. Reddit's Footnote 8 Is a Red Herring**
   - The conflict/express preemption distinction doesn't change the outcome
   - Both involve the same underlying question: do state law claims seek to protect copyright rights?

This approach reframes the debate from "what type of preemption did Bright Data apply?" to "do Reddit's claims fall within Section 301(a)?"—which is the proper complete preemption inquiry.

## Pressure Question

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the mischaracterization. Looking more carefully at Bright Data:

The court explicitly states at page 850-851:

> "Although **conflict preemption has played second fiddle to express preemption** in the caselaw as of late, **it is the more appropriate consideration** when the question presented is not whether rights created by state law are equivalent to rights created by federal copyright law but whether enforcement of state law undermines federal copyright law."

And the headnotes confirm all claims were preempted "pursuant to **doctrine of conflict preemption**" (headnotes 27-29).

You're correct—**Judge Alsup chose conflict preemption over express preemption** for his analysis.

## The Real Problem for Anthropic

This creates a significant issue for your removal argument because:

1. **Reddit's footnote 8 is legally correct**: Bright Data analyzed conflict preemption, not express preemption
2. **Ninth Circuit law is clear**: "conflict preemption does not give rise to complete preemption in any circumstance" (*ARCO*, 213 F.3d at 1114)
3. **Without complete preemption, there's no removal jurisdiction**

## Your Actual Path Forward

You need to **abandon reliance on Bright Data for jurisdictional purposes** and instead argue:

### **Primary Argument: Section 301(a) Express Preemption Applies Here**

Even though Bright Data used conflict preemption, **you should argue Reddit's claims satisfy Section 301(a) express preemption**:

1. **Distinguish Bright Data's choice of framework**: Judge Alsup found conflict preemption "more appropriate" for X Corp's specific terms of service claims, but that doesn't mean express preemption doesn't also apply to scraping cases

2. **Apply the express preemption test directly**:
   - Reddit users' posts are copyrightable works (within subject matter)
   - Reddit's claims seek to prevent reproduction/use of those works (equivalent rights under § 106)
   
3. **Cite cases that DID find express preemption in scraping cases**:
   - Your Notice of Removal cites *Yu v. ByteDance*, 2023 WL 5671932 (which discusses both complete preemption and express preemption for scraping)
   - Look for other district court cases that found express preemption for web scraping/terms of service violations

### **What You Should Concede**

In your opposition brief, acknowledge:
- "Reddit correctly notes that Bright Data's holding rested on conflict preemption analysis"
- "Conflict preemption alone cannot support removal jurisdiction"
- **BUT** "the question here is whether Reddit's claims satisfy Section 301(a) express preemption, which does support complete preemption"

### **Focus on the Firoozye Line of Cases**

The *Firoozye* case (153 F. Supp. 2d 1115) and its progeny hold that Section 301(a) express preemption **does** effect complete preemption. This is your real jurisdictional foundation, not Bright Data.

## Honest Assessment

Reddit's footnote 8 identifies a real weakness in your removal argument **as currently framed**. Bright Data doesn't support removal jurisdiction because it analyzed the wrong type of preemption. You need to reframe your argument around Section 301(a) express preemption directly, using Bright Data only for its **substantive analysis** of why scraping claims are preempted, not for the jurisdictional question.

Would you like me to search for additional cases that found express preemption (not just conflict preemption) in similar web scraping/terms of service contexts?
