## Table-Setting Question

In footnote 8 of its Motion to Remand, Reddit argues that Anthropic’s reliance on **X Corp. v. Bright Data** is misplaced. Anthropic cited that case to suggest Reddit’s contract and related claims are preempted by the Copyright Act. Reddit responds that **Bright Data** only involved the ordinary affirmative defense of *conflict preemption*, not *complete preemption*. Conflict preemption, Reddit explains, cannot create federal jurisdiction or justify removal—it is just a defense to a state-law claim. Under Ninth Circuit precedent like *ARCO* and *Toumajian*, only complete preemption can support removal, and Bright Data never held that.

In short: Reddit’s footnote 8 position is that Anthropic cannot use *Bright Data* to bootstrap removal jurisdiction because that case dealt solely with conflict preemption, which is irrelevant to complete preemption.

## Legal-Analysis Question

Here’s the clean way to answer Reddit’s footnote-8 point and still keep removal intact for Anthropic:

# 1) What Reddit says about *Bright Data* is too narrow

Reddit argues *X Corp. v. Bright Data* dealt only with **conflict preemption** (an ordinary defense) and therefore can’t support removal. Fair enough as far as it goes—but we’re **not** relying on *Bright Data* as the jurisdictional hook. We rely on **complete preemption under 17 U.S.C. § 301** for at least one of Reddit’s claims; *Bright Data* is persuasive authority on the **equivalency** analysis (i.e., whether the state-law rights Reddit asserts are equivalent to exclusive rights within the scope of copyright). The court there held that state-law claims aimed at controlling the scraping and sale of public posts “would entrench [a] private copyright system” and are preempted, because they attempt to wield a copyright-like right to exclude over users’ content. That reasoning squarely supports the **equivalency prong** of § 301.

# 2) Our actual jurisdictional basis is § 301 complete preemption

Ninth Circuit and district court cases make removal proper where a plaintiff’s state-law claim is **completely preempted** by § 301 (subject matter + equivalency). Several on-point decisions show claims just like Reddit’s are within copyright’s subject matter and assert rights equivalent to reproduction, display, distribution, or derivative works:

* **Best Carpet Values v. Google (9th Cir. 2024)** — held that commercial websites can be copyrightable subject matter and that **implied-in-law contract** and **unjust enrichment** claims that target copying/display/derivative use are **preempted** (no extra element). That’s powerful support that Reddit’s unjust-enrichment theory (and any implied-in-law flavor) is completely preempted.

* **Media.net v. NetSeer (N.D. Cal. 2016)** — UCL and interference claims tied to website copying were preempted; confirms that state-law claims repackaging reproduction/display/distribution are § 301-barred.

* **Sybersound v. UAV (9th Cir. 2008)** — state claims depending on showing infringement (or equivalent) are preempted.

* **Kabehie v. Zoland (Cal. Ct. App. 2002)** — distinguishes contract theories: when a contract claim is **functionally about copying/distribution**, it’s preempted; only contract promises with **qualitatively different** elements escape. That helps us sort Reddit’s counts and identify at least one completely-preempted claim for removal.

Crucially, **we don’t need every claim preempted**; removal is proper if **any** claim (or a separable portion of a claim) is completely preempted. That’s exactly what the Northern District did in **Yu v. ByteDance**: it found **partial § 301 preemption**, removal was proper, dismissed the preempted piece, and then considered whether to keep or remand the rest. We should urge the same path here.

# 3) How *Bright Data* still helps us

Even if *Bright Data* frames its holding as conflict preemption, its analysis maps directly onto § 301’s **equivalency** inquiry we need for complete preemption:

* It explains that claims policing scraping/sale of **public** user content assert a de facto right to exclude others from copying and exploiting that content—**a copyright-equivalent right**—and therefore must bow to the federal scheme. That point supports our § 301 argument that Reddit’s **unjust enrichment**, **UCL**, and any **contract theory whose only “breach” is scraping/using content beyond Reddit’s preferred API** are completely preempted.

* It rejects attempts to use TOU/UCL to create a “private copyright system,” which is the very thing § 301’s **complete preemption** forbids when state law is used to control copying/distribution of works within copyright’s subject matter.

# 4) Anticipate Reddit’s authorities and distinguish

Reddit cites Ninth Circuit removal cases that separate conflict vs. complete preemption (e.g., **Toumajian**; **ARCO**). We agree on the doctrine—but **our removal rests on complete preemption**, not conflict preemption. And our merits showings align with **Best Carpet Values**, **Media.net**, and **Sybersound**—all recognizing § 301 preemption of **unjust enrichment/implied-contract/UCL** theories that rise or fall on copying/using website content.

Reddit may also lean on **Ryan v. Editions** to say “contracts aren’t preempted.” True: a **genuine** contract claim with a qualitatively different promise (e.g., a payment obligation or a duty unrelated to copying rights) can avoid § 301. But **Kabehie** shows when the alleged “breach” is just **copying/using/distributing content**, it’s preempted. If Reddit’s contract and UCL theories boil down to “you copied/scraped/sold content outside our preferred interface,” those are equivalent to § 106 rights and are completely preempted.

# 5) Practical roadmap for our response

* **Lead with § 301 complete preemption**: Identify the claim(s) (or part(s)) that target copying, display, distribution, or derivative use of Reddit content (e.g., unjust enrichment; UCL; any contract theory whose only breach is scraping/using content). Show subject-matter + equivalency using **Best Carpet Values**, **Media.net**, **Sybersound**, **Kabehie**. Then cite **Yu v. ByteDance** for the removal-then-triage path.

* **Use *Bright Data* as persuasive backup** for the equivalency analysis, not as the jurisdictional hook: quote its reasoning that these state claims attempt to exercise a copyright owner’s right to exclude and thus conflict with the federal scheme. That’s the same conduct § 301 occupies.

* **Acknowledge non-preempted islands (if any)**: If Reddit’s **trespass to chattels** theory is truly about server harm, that can be non-preempted; but removal still stands because one claim is completely preempted. The court can then (i) dismiss the preempted count(s), and (ii) decide whether to keep supplemental jurisdiction or remand the rest—**just like Yu**.

### One-paragraph pushback for the brief

Reddit’s footnote 8 misses the point. We do not invoke *X Corp. v. Bright Data* as a jurisdictional basis; we invoke **complete preemption under § 301**, and **Ninth Circuit precedent** squarely holds that state-law unjust-enrichment, implied-contract, UCL, and similar claims that police copying, display, or distribution of website content are **completely preempted** (e.g., **Best Carpet Values**, **Media.net**, **Sybersound**). *Bright Data*’s analysis is still highly persuasive on the **equivalency** prong—it explains why attempts to control scraping/sale of public user content assert copyright-equivalent rights. That’s exactly the § 301 inquiry. And as **Yu v. ByteDance** shows, **partial § 301 preemption is enough for removal**; the court can then dismiss the preempted portion and decide what to do with any remaining state-law claims.

If you’d like, I can draft the specific section headings and record cites for the opposition.

## Pressure-Question 

QUESTION: "I don't see where Bright Data supports an equivalency analysis. It seems to me it expressly says it is doing conflict preemption analysis not an equivalency analysis. Where do you see otherwise?"

You’re right that **Bright Data** frames its holding as **conflict preemption**. We’re not saying it *formally* did a §301 “equivalency” analysis. Our point is narrower: the court’s *reasoning about the nature of the right X was asserting* maps directly onto §301’s equivalency inquiry (i.e., are the state-law rights effectively the copyright owner’s exclusive rights?).

Here are the passages we’re relying on:

* The court said X was trying to “**exercise a copyright owner’s right to exclude**” by using state contract/tort law to control others’ copying and resale of public posts, and that this would “**entrench its own private copyright system** that rivals, even conflicts with, the actual copyright system enacted by Congress.” That’s the essence of the §301 equivalency prong (state rights ≈ §106 rights like reproduction/distribution).

* It emphasized the claims were aimed at **scraping and selling** (i.e., extracting and copying public content), and held that, to that extent, X’s **state-law claims are preempted** because they “amount to little more than camouflage for an attempt to exercise control over the exploitation of a copyright.” Again, that’s the same conduct §301 treats as within copyright’s exclusive domain.

* The order also underlined that the case dealt with **publicly available** posts and described scraping as **extracting data and copying it** into a structured format—basic reproduction/use acts that are copyright’s core.

So yes, the **label** the court used was “conflict preemption,” but the **substantive description** of the right X tried to enforce (a copyright-like right to exclude others from copying/exploiting user content) is the same description courts use when finding **§301 equivalency**. That’s why we treat Bright Data as persuasive on equivalency, while relying on cases like **Best Carpet Values**, **Media.net**, and **Sybersound** for the **actual §301 complete-preemption rule** that permits removal.

In short: Bright Data doesn’t *hold* on equivalency; it **describes** the state-law theory as a copyright-equivalent right. We use that description to satisfy §301’s equivalency prong, and then cite the Ninth Circuit §301 cases for the jurisdictional consequence (complete preemption → removal).
