## Table Setting Question

Of course. Here is a summary of Reddit's argument in footnote 8 of its Motion to Remand.

In footnote 8, Reddit argues that Anthropic's reliance on the *X Corp. v. Bright Data* case is fundamentally flawed because it confuses two distinct and critical types of legal preemption:

1.  **The *Bright Data* case addressed "conflict preemption."** Reddit asserts that the legal analysis in *Bright Data* was limited to conflict preemption, which is an *ordinary affirmative defense*. A defendant can raise this defense in state court to argue that a state law claim should be dismissed because it conflicts with federal law.

2.  **Conflict preemption does not create federal jurisdiction.** Crucially, Reddit argues that conflict preemption is merely a defense and **cannot** be used as a basis to remove a case from state court to federal court. It does not confer federal jurisdiction.

3.  **Removal requires "complete preemption."** For Anthropic's removal to be proper, it must show that Reddit's claims fall under the much rarer doctrine of "complete preemption," a jurisdictional rule where federal law so entirely occupies a legal field that any state claim is actually considered a federal claim from its inception.

In summary, Reddit contends that Anthropic is improperly citing a case about a **substantive defense** (conflict preemption) to justify a **jurisdictional removal**, which requires a completely different legal standard (complete preemption). Therefore, according to Reddit, the *Bright Data* precedent is irrelevant to the question of removal and does not support Anthropic's attempt to move the case to federal court.

## Legal-Analysis Question

Of course. Based on a review of the relevant case law, here is a strategic breakdown of how Anthropic should respond to Reddit's argument in footnote 8 regarding the *X Corp. v. Bright Data* case.

### Executive Summary

Reddit’s argument is a classic misdirection that focuses on a legal label ("conflict preemption") while ignoring the substantive and highly relevant reasoning of the *Bright Data* decision. Our response should acknowledge the technical difference between conflict and complete preemption but pivot immediately to demonstrate that the *reasoning* in *Bright Data* provides a powerful, factually analogous roadmap for why Reddit's claims are, in substance, completely preempted and thus removable to federal court.

### Recommended Response Strategy

We should structure our response brief around the following three key points:

#### 1. Acknowledge the Distinction, then Reframe the Issue to Substance Over Labels

Begin by directly addressing Reddit's point, but immediately reframe it.

**Talking Point:** "Reddit is correct that there is a legal distinction between defensive 'conflict preemption' and jurisdictional 'complete preemption.' However, their argument that *Bright Data* is therefore irrelevant is fundamentally wrong. The label used by the *Bright Data* court is less important than its substantive analysis, which is the most recent and factually analogous decision from this District addressing the central issue here: a social media platform's attempt to use state-law claims to create a private, copyright-like monopoly over publicly available, user-generated content."

**Supporting Analysis:**
The court in *Bright Data* engaged in a deep analysis of how X Corp.'s state-law contract and tort claims functioned to "entrench its own private copyright system that rivals, even conflicts with, the actual copyright system enacted by Congress." (*X Corp. v. Bright Data*, 733 F. Supp. 3d at 850).

This is the core of our argument for complete preemption. We contend that Reddit's claims are not merely *in conflict* with the Copyright Act; they are so fundamentally intertwined with the rights granted by the Act that they are, in effect, federal copyright claims in disguise. *Bright Data*'s reasoning provides the direct analytical support for this conclusion, regardless of the "conflict" label the court ultimately used.

#### 2. Use *Bright Data*'s Reasoning to Satisfy the Two-Part Test for Complete Preemption

The established test for copyright preemption asks two questions: (1) Does the work fall within the subject matter of copyright? and (2) Are the state-law rights asserted "equivalent" to the exclusive rights under the Copyright Act? We should show how *Bright Data*'s logic helps us prove the second, more critical prong.

**Talking Point:** "The reasoning in *Bright Data* demonstrates precisely why Reddit's state-law claims are 'equivalent' to exclusive copyright rights. Just like X Corp., Reddit is using state contract and tort law to assert a right to control the reproduction, distribution, and creation of derivative works from publicly available content—rights that are the exclusive domain of the Copyright Act."

**Supporting Analysis:**

*   **Subject Matter:** This is undisputed. The user-generated posts, comments, and media on Reddit fall squarely within the subject matter of copyright.
*   **Equivalent Rights:** This is the key battleground.
    *   **The "Extra Element" Test:** Reddit claims its contract and tort claims have "extra elements" (e.g., the promise in the User Agreement, a tortious act) that make them qualitatively different from a copyright claim.
    *   **Our Counterargument (supported by *Bright Data*):** The *Bright Data* court looked past the superficial state-law labels and found that the *substance* of the claims was an attempt to "exclude others from using, copying, reproducing... and distributing X users' content." (*Id.* at 849). Similarly, the core of Reddit’s complaint is that we copied (reproduced) its users' data to create a new work (trained our model, a derivative work).
    *   The "extra element" in Reddit's contract claim is merely a promise not to engage in acts of reproduction and commercial exploitation. Courts have consistently held that such claims are preempted. As the court found in *Firoozye v. Earthlink Network*, a contract claim based on a "bare promise not to use a certain work" is preempted because it is not qualitatively different from a copyright claim. (153 F. Supp. 2d at 1127).
    *   The court in *X Corp. v. Bright Data* characterized X Corp's effort as "little more than camouflage for an attempt to exercise control over the exploitation of a copyright." (*Id.* at 853, quoting *In re Jackson*). We must argue that Reddit's lawsuit is identical in purpose and effect.

#### 3. Emphasize Judicial Consistency Within the Northern District of California

Finally, we must contextualize *Bright Data* by showing it aligns with other decisions from this district, including a crucial one from the very judge presiding over this case.

**Talking Point:** "The substantive holding in *Bright Data* is not an outlier. It reflects a consistent view in this District that federal copyright law governs disputes over the scraping and use of publicly available online content. In fact, this Court's own precedent in *Yu v. ByteDance* reached a similar conclusion on the issue of complete preemption."

**Supporting Analysis:**

*   ***Yu v. ByteDance Inc.* (2023 WL 5671932):** This case is our strongest supporting authority. In *Yu*, Judge Illston found that a UCL claim based on the scraping of online videos was **completely preempted** by the Copyright Act, thus establishing a proper basis for removal. The court explicitly held that online videos fall within the subject matter of copyright and that a claim based on unauthorized scraping and reproduction seeks to vindicate rights equivalent to those under the Copyright Act.
*   **Connecting the Dots:** We must argue: "In *Yu*, this Court recognized that a state-law claim based on scraping online content is fundamentally a copyright issue properly heard in federal court. The detailed analysis in *Bright Data* explains *why* such claims are so problematic—because they disrupt the federal copyright scheme. Read together, these cases provide a clear and consistent basis for finding Reddit's claims completely preempted."
*   ***Best Carpet Values, Inc. v. Google, LLC* (90 F.4th 962):** While this case dealt with defensive preemption, the Ninth Circuit's reasoning is still useful. It affirmed that claims involving the reproduction and display of website content fall within the subject matter of copyright and implicate rights equivalent to copyright. It found preemption where the state-law claim lacked a true "extra element." We can use this to reinforce that Reddit's claims, which lack a meaningful extra element beyond the alleged copying, are equivalent to copyright claims.

### Conclusion for the Brief

Reddit's attempt to dismiss *Bright Data* is a semantic argument that ignores the case's powerful substantive reasoning. That reasoning—that state contract law cannot be used to create a private copyright system over public data—is directly on point and explains *why* Reddit's claims are not merely in conflict with copyright law, but are completely preempted by it. This conclusion is consistent with this Court's own precedent in *Yu v. ByteDance* and firmly establishes that removal to federal court was proper.

## Pressure Question

You have hit upon the most critical and nuanced point of this legal argument, and your skepticism is entirely justified. Let me clarify the strategy. You are correct: the *Bright Data* court explicitly states it is conducting a **conflict preemption** analysis. It does not hold that the claims are **completely preempted**.

So, how can we use it?

The strategy is not to claim that *Bright Data* is a complete preemption case. **It is not, and to argue otherwise would be a misrepresentation of the holding and damage our credibility.**

Instead, the strategy is to **leverage the *reasoning* of *Bright Data*'s conflict preemption analysis to prove the essential elements of our complete preemption argument.** The legal tests, while having different names and jurisdictional outcomes, share a crucial analytical core. Our argument is that the very logic the *Bright Data* court used to find a *conflict* is the same logic this court should use to find *completeness*.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to make this argument effectively:

---

### The Argument: How *Bright Data*'s Conflict Analysis Proves Complete Preemption

#### 1. Frame the Test for Complete Preemption

First, we must state the test for complete preemption under the Copyright Act, which you correctly identified in your Notice of Removal. The key question is whether Reddit's state-law claims are **“equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright”** under § 106. (This is often called the "equivalency" or "extra element" test).

*   The rights under § 106 are, fundamentally, the rights to **reproduce**, **prepare derivative works**, and **distribute** copies of a work.
*   Reddit’s claims survive preemption only if they contain an "extra element" that makes them *qualitatively different* from a copyright infringement claim.

#### 2. Introduce *Bright Data*'s Substantive Analysis (Not its Label)

This is where we pivot. We will argue:

"While the court in *X Corp. v. Bright Data* ultimately framed its holding in terms of 'conflict preemption,' its detailed substantive analysis of X Corp.'s state-law claims is the most on-point judicial examination of the very issues before this Court. The *Bright Data* court’s reasoning provides a compelling roadmap for *why* Reddit’s claims are, in fact, 'equivalent' to copyright claims and thus completely preempted."

#### 3. Show How *Bright Data*'s Reasoning Decimates the "Extra Element" Argument

This is the core of the argument. We will walk the court through *Bright Data*'s logic to show that Reddit’s supposed "extra elements" are illusory.

*   **The "Camouflage" Argument:** The *Bright Data* court found that X Corp.’s state-law claims (breach of contract, unjust enrichment, etc.) were **"little more than camouflage for an attempt to exercise control over the exploitation of a copyright."** (*Bright Data*, 733 F. Supp. 3d at 853).
    *   **Our Application:** We will argue that Reddit is doing the exact same thing. Its breach of contract claim is not about a unique contractual promise; it's a claim that we violated the User Agreement by *copying and reproducing* user content. The contract is merely the vehicle for asserting a copyright-like exclusive right.

*   **The "Rival System" Argument:** The court explained that X Corp. was attempting to "entrench its own private copyright system that rivals, even conflicts with, the actual copyright system enacted by Congress." (*Id.* at 850).
    *   **Our Application:** This language is perfect for us. We argue that Reddit’s User Agreement is an attempt to create a private intellectual property regime that bypasses the limitations and user rights (like fair use) inherent in the federal Copyright Act. A claim that seeks to enforce such a "rival system" cannot be "qualitatively different" from a copyright claim; it is, by its nature, an attempt to supplant it.

*   **The "Substance of the Right" Argument:** The *Bright Data* court looked past the state-law labels to the *substance* of the right being protected. It concluded the right was the control over reproduction and distribution of user content.
    *   **Our Application:** We apply that same logic here. The harm Reddit alleges is not a simple contract breach; it is the unauthorized **copying** of data to **create a derivative work** (our AI model) for **distribution** (commercial use). These are the quintessential rights protected exclusively by § 106 of the Copyright Act.

#### 4. Connect the "Obstacle" of Conflict Preemption to the "Equivalence" of Complete Preemption

This is the final logical step that bridges the two doctrines for the court.

**Argument:** "The very reasons the *Bright Data* court found that X Corp.'s claims 'stand as an obstacle' to the purposes of the Copyright Act (the test for conflict preemption) are the same reasons this Court should find that the rights Reddit asserts are 'equivalent to' the exclusive rights in the Copyright Act (the test for complete preemption). An action that creates a 'rival copyright system' and functions as 'camouflage' for a copyright claim does not contain a 'qualitatively different' extra element. It is, in its essence, a federal copyright claim."

### Why This Strategy Works

1.  **It Uses the Best Factual Analogy:** *Bright Data* is the single most factually similar case we have. It involves a major social media platform, scraping of public user data, use of that data for a commercial purpose, and state-law claims based on a user agreement. Its reasoning is far more persuasive than a case with dissimilar facts.
2.  **It Demonstrates Sophisticated Legal Analysis:** It shows we understand the distinction between the doctrines but are making a deeper, more substantive argument about the *underlying legal principles* that animate both.
3.  **It Is Honest to the Court:** We are not pretending *Bright Data* is a complete preemption case. We are respectfully telling the court that its reasoning is so compelling and on-point that it should inform this court's complete preemption analysis.
4.  **It Complements Our Other Cases:** We can then seamlessly integrate it with cases like ***Yu v. ByteDance***, where this very court *did* find complete preemption on similar facts. The argument becomes: "*Yu* establishes that scraping claims *can be* completely preempted, and *Bright Data* provides the deep analytical framework for explaining *why* they must be in this case."

In short, we are not citing *Bright Data* for its holding on removal jurisdiction. We are citing it for its **authoritative analysis of the nature of the state-law claims**, which is a necessary predicate to determining whether those claims are completely preempted.
