NB: I re-ran the tasts after posting the video in order to ensure results were consistent across models and to get the results of Claude Sonnet 4.5 which happened to be released the exact same day I made this post.

Results are available in ./20250929 folder in this repo.

If you want me to add your results, follow the instructions in INSTRUCTIONS.md and send me the responses. Especially interested if someone wants to run it on Harvey, Legora, CoCounsel, etc. I don't have access to any of those and am curious if they do better than frontier models.
