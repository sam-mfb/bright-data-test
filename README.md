# The Bright Data Test

Repository for information on the Bright Data Test for legal analysis by LLMs.

## Motivation

My fundamental premise is that people are making claims about LLMs' ability to replace junior lawyers, but I haven't seen any data one way or the other that demonstrates how they do on legal analysis. 

This is an attempt to make a start.

## Background

The legal rational for the test is explained in detail here:

## Results

Results with frontier models and a discussion on LinkedIn here:

NB: I re-ran the tasts after posting the video in order to ensure prompts were consistent across models and to get the results of Claude Sonnet 4.5 which happened to be released the exact same day I made this post.

Results are available in ./20250929 folder in this repo.

## Contributions

If you want me to add your results, follow the instructions in INSTRUCTIONS.md and send me the responses. Especially interested if someone wants to run it on Harvey, Legora, CoCounsel, etc. I don't have access to any of those and am curious if they do better than frontier models.
